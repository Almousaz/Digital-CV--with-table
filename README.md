# Requirements ðŸ“‹

1. **Integrating a Form**: Add a form to your digital CV. Possible fields are name, email, phone number, organization, role, reason for contact (such as job offers, collaborations, or feedback), preferred contact method, and a message.
2. **Utilization of HTML Elements**: Your form should, at a minimum, use the following HTML elements:
    - `form`: Defines the form.
    - `label`: Describes the linked input field.
    - `input`: Takes user input, allowing different types. Use at least 3 different types.
    - `textarea`: Takes user input, allowing a more extended area.
    - `button`: Allows users to take action on the form.
3. **Using Necessary Attributes**: Ensure you're applying essential attributes for a smooth user experience, such as using the `required` attribute for mandatory fields and the `placeholder` attribute to guide users on what to input.
4. **Submitting the Form**: For the purposes of this exercise, the form doesn't need to submit data to a server. However, using a `#` as the form action can simulate a form submission.
5. **Using Comments**: As always, incorporate comments in your HTML code to describe different sections of your form.
